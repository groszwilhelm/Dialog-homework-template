## Create a Dialog Component using HTML and CSS

### Requirements:

1. The dialog should be open when entering the page, there is no need for it to close and open using javascript.
2. The dialog should be centered to the middle of the screen no matter how large it gets. 
3. Add some limitations so that the dialog hight and width doesn't exceed 700px in width and 500px in height.
4. In case the content doesn't fit inside the dialog a vertical scrollbar should appear (but only then, if the content fits in the screen, th scrollbar shouldn't be visible).
5. The Dialog Backdrop should have a tint of grey and be transparent.
6. Even though the background is transparent as a user I shouldn't be able to interact with the content underneath it (Ex: shouldn't be able to select text, click on buttons, etc. that are behind the dialog).
7. Try to recreate the design in the two images as shown.
8. Take not that the dialog has 2 themes, a light theme and a dark theme. Consider using CSS variables to customize it. 
There is no need to dynamically switch between the two themes, just have them in css and switch between them by commenting the variables for theme one and uncommenting the variables in theme 2 and vice versa.
9. The icon in the images doesn't have to be the same, use something from font awesome (https://fontawesome.com/)
